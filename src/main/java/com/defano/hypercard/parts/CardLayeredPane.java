    /**
     * A total hack.
     *
     * This layered pane consists of four layers (back to front):
     *
     *    background paint -> background parts -> foreground graphics -> foreground parts.
     *
     * Unfortunately, the foreground graphics layer is the size of the card window; as long as it's visible (according
     * to {@link #isVisible()}) the background layers behind it will not receive mouse events or focus. We could work
     * around this by re-dispatching the mouse events, but that doesn't fix the focus problem: A field will never
     * receive focus as long as Swing believes it be fully obstructed by a component in front of it (our foreground
     * canvas, in this case).
     *
     * Swing does not support the idea of a Component that "passes" events and focus to components behind it; that's
     * what is really needed here.
     *
     * So, as a workaround, we always hide the foreground canvas, except when re-painting the card or when a paint tool
     * is active (so that it can painted on via the JMonet tools).
     *
     * @param g The paint manager's graphic context
